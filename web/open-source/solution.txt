Notice that /.git is served on the website. You can use a tool like GitHacker to download the source of the server. 

If you check then git log, there is a commit called "Whoops removed keys from git". Revert this, and look at .env.
.env includes "SECRET_KEY", which is used for signing JWT keys.

Login to the website, and get our jwt key from localStorage.
Put our key into jwt.io, paste in the secret key (from .env) and change the username in the payload to 'admin'.
Replace the jwt key in our localstorage with the newly generated one, and refresh.

Dashboard should show the flag as a result.
